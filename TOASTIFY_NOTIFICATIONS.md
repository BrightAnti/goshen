## 🔧 How It Works

### Setup

1. `ToastProvider` component wraps the admin layout
2. Imports the CSS styles from react-toastify
3. Configures the toast container with options

### Usage in Components

```tsx
import { toast } from "react-toastify";

// Simple success
toast.success("Item saved!");

// Simple error
toast.error("Failed to save!");

// With promise (loading state)
toast.promise(deleteItem(), {
  pending: "Deleting...",
  success: "Deleted! 🎉",
  error: "Failed to delete",
});
```

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Desktop

- Appears in top-right corner
- Full-width toast messages
- Smooth slide-in animation

### Mobile

- Automatically adjusts width
- Still top-right but responsive
- Touch-friendly dismiss

---

## 🎨 Customization Options

If you want to customize the toasts, edit `components/ui/ToastProvider.tsx`:

### Change Position

```tsx
position = "top-right"; // Options: top-left, top-center, top-right,
// bottom-left, bottom-center, bottom-right
```

### Change Auto-Close Time

```tsx
autoClose={3000}  // Time in milliseconds (3000 = 3 seconds)
```

### Change Theme

```tsx
theme = "light"; // Options: light, dark, colored
```

### Hide Progress Bar

```tsx
hideProgressBar={true}
```
